# Hangman

Welcome to my very best training project in Python.

**How it works:**
- Choose what you want to do in menu
- Play a game by guessing a letter in randomly picked word from word library.
- You can print scoreboards (not sorting yet)
- You can add words to the library

**When will come up next?**
- Sorted scoreboard in TOP 10 format
- Better scoring mechanism
